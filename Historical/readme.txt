The Android support became too hard to maintain because of the reliance on Scala 2.11 and the general feeling that the Scala community lost interest in Android.

The meta project was an experiment too see what could be gained from not constructing the dataflow graph directly but just declare all reactives first, then do optimizations and analysis on a meta representation of the graph, and then build the graph from the resulting structure. However, this project essentially had to override all the existing APIs, which made it very brittle whenever the main implementation changed.

dividi and paroli are two case studies for an early version of CRDTs and delta CRDTs. Dividi is a graphical money sharing app, however it depends on some javafx extensions which are no longer maintained. Paroli is a console based chat using akka cluster which always breaks unexpectedly.

The distributed multiversion implementation is described in [1]. Unfortunately, the code mixes a very complex domain, with an implementation that relies on a very fine grained and tangled communication model. This makes the result incredibly hard to maintain. Specifically, it is currently completely unknown if any semantic changes in REScala have broken the assumption this codebase makes. Moreover, something makes parts of the project extremely slow to compile, which makes executing it as part of the CI or similar undesirable.

Documentation is what was written as parts of various endeavours over the years. These things usually have been integrated into the repo somewhere, but the standalone documentation was never maintained. Either refer to the scaladoc, or ask your local expert for help.

The Graph-Compiler package allows compilation of parts of rescala to C code, however the pipeline is currently untested and unmaintained
